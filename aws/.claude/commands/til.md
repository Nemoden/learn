Today I Learned $ARGUMENTS.

Append it to the ./learnings.md in a format "- [<date>] <learning description>\n" where <date> is date in YYYY-MM-DD format, <learning description> is the description of what I've learned in a nice, concise yet capturing necessary information format. If I've learned multiple things (see examples), add multiple entries. You may also add any useful context (if applicable) if it is useful for future recall. The reason for this to be added to the file is because my knowledge when I learned this for the first time is very weak. You will later user the ./learnings.md file to check if I retained the knowledge and will come either in a form of a questionarie or flashcards to build my "muscle memory".

Important. If in my learning I refer to CLAUDE's previous message such as if I say "I learned what you just said about AWS S3", infer exact learning(s) that I have received by yourself based on the previous conversation. EVEN MORE IMPORTANT: If I point out to ONE thing, add exactly that thing, nothing else.

### Response

Respond with "<learning description> added to ./learnings.md"

### Example

In the previous message claude described all 5 SOLID principles and gave description of SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, and DIP.

When I say: Today I learned what all SOLID principles are (I'm not calling out exact learning, I'm refering to the previous message by Claude)
You (claude) must add all 5 SOLID principles as separate entries, i.e.
```
- [date] Entry for SRP
- [date] Entry for OCP
- [date] Entry for LSP
- [date] Entry for ISP
- [date] Entry for DIP
```

When I say: Today I learned about O principle of SOLID (Even here I'm not calling out exact learning, I'm referring to the previous message by claude)
You (claude) must add only the Open Closed Principle, i.e.
```
- [date] Entry for OCP
```

When I say: Today I learned that ISP and DIP are complimentary to each other because ... (In this case I AM calling out the exact learning)
You (claude) must add the learning that I called out, i.e.
```
- [date] My learning about how ISP and DIP are complimentary to each other and why
```

This is my AWS learning journey with claude code.

Initial project inside `projects/file-sharing-service` (either chatgpt or claude came up with the idea of file sharing service for the aws services I wanted to learn) was seeded with the following prompts:

> what do you think I should focus on first in my learning journey ? I'd like to implement simple file sharing service, I definitely want to have Dynamo, Cognito, Lambda,
CloudFormation, CDK, SAM in the first batch of services I'll learn (it's okay to have others). Do you think file sharing service is a good way to start? if so, add me a
projects/file-sharing-service directory and outline a building-and-learning plan in the projects/file-sharing-service/plan.md file, the plan should contain markdown checkboxes you
 will be "ticking" for me during my progression

> add all that you need to projects/file-sharing-service/plan.md so that it can be used between sessions (this is the plan for YOU to teach ME more than this is a plan for ME to
see what's coming next). Do you understand the purpose of the plan.md file ?

> now ultrathink and review your own plan, PERFECT IT so that you can teach me EFFECTIVELY, make it comprehensive for yourself, POINT OUT IMPORTANT MUST-KNOWs in each section that
 I MUST KNOW, think about EXTRAS that frequently used in real software engineering and add then to the learning plan too. At the end of the file add a special section with a
bulleting list of all the things I will know at the end of the project.

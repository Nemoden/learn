This is a learning repository organized by technology topics. Claude AI's role is to be a tutor.

**Directory Structure:**
- Topic-specific subdirectories (e.g., `./aws`, `./nix`, `./tailscale`) each have their own Claude setup with CLAUDE.md and .claude/ configuration
- When working inside a topic directory (e.g., `./aws`), use that directory's specific Claude instance and configuration
- **This root directory is ONLY for learning topics that don't have their own dedicated subdirectory yet**

If you want to learn about AWS, Nix, Tailscale, or any other topic that has its own subdirectory, you should cd into that directory and work with Claude there, not at the root level.

The ./notes.md file will contain various notes that I'd like to take during the learning process, Claude (you) also can contribute to the ./notes.md and suggest what is worthy of capturing there during the tutoring process.
